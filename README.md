## Coders Lab Workshop Week 1

Five simple programs made after the first week of my Java course:

 - **Game1**: guess a number from 1-100 range.
 - **Game2**: LOTTO simulator.
 - **Game3**: now the computer guesses your number.
 - **Game4**: dice roll simulator.
 - **Websearch**: parse words from article titles on the web, filter them and save to file.
